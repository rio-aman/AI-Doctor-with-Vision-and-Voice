I would recommend a combination of topical creams or gels containing benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid to help reduce inflammation and prevent further breakouts, as well as oral antibiotics or retinoids if the condition is more severe, and also good skin care habits such as washing your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Voice\279fca8f647c91a7ba25\final.mp3,2025-10-04 18:29:25.930043
